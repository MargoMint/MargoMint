# 👋 Hi, I’m Margarita — a Front-End Developer based in Gdańsk, Poland

I’m a junior developer with a strong foundation in modern front-end technologies, gained through the intensive “JavaScript / Front-End” course at RS School. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, responsive, and accessible web interfaces.

I recently took part in a team project where we built a production-level eCommerce app using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Commercetools**. This experience helped me dive deeper into real-world development, Agile workflows, and team collaboration.

🔍 I’m curious, fast-learning, and always looking to grow. I value clean code, thoughtful UI, and working in teams where shared learning and responsibility are encouraged.
