# 👋 Hi, I’m Margarita — a Front-End Developer based in Gdańsk, Poland

Frontend Developer with a strong theoretical and practical foundation gained through the RS School “JS / Front-End” and “React” courses. Skilled in building responsive layouts and developing applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and modern development tools. Took part in a team project to deliver a production-level eCommerce application with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Commercetools. Served as a team leader in the final project of the React course, coordinating development and ensuring successful delivery. Experienced with Agile workflows, code quality practices, and unit testing. A strong team player, quick to learn, detail-oriented, and ready to contribute to real-world development.

🔍 I’m curious, fast-learning, and always looking to grow. I value clean code, thoughtful UI, and working in teams where shared learning and responsibility are encouraged.
